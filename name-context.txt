Gray: We've devolved from the Fermi problem of "how many wasps would fit in our office building" to discussing the thermodynamics and phase equilibrium of wasps and chickens.
Kate: I've definitely gone through the "piano tuners in NYC" question with Kyle before, while talking about tech interviewing
Gray: The ones that always come to mind for me, for inexplicable reasons, are "How many polar bears fit inside the sun?" and "How many piano tuners are there in Canada?"
Kate: Polar bears in the sun is a good one. Do we account for the atomization of the bears? Like, do they have to be intact bears, or can the originating incinerated materials just be derived from said bears?
Gray: See, this exact train of reasoning is how the wasp question got so out of hand, because we started trying to figure out the packing efficiency, thermodynamics, and whether you could treat them as an ideal gas (conclusion: probably more ideal than mosquitoes).

Charismatic Megafauna

Review of the Osaka Aquarium: "It was generally a very good aquarium as well...probably the best one I’ve been to? Just for sheer interesting stuff, plenty of room, and a great deal of charismatic megafauna. The dolphins in particular were pretty incredible to watch."

Ghost Fondue
----
Gray: Someone at Slosh was trying to explain the idea of dipping someone completely in Hibiclens to prevent them from figuring out where you're going to put needles. I truly have no idea how they thought, "Like ghost fondue!" would clarify this, but that's what they said.

Orthogonalized Spaghetti

Gray: courtesy of this context-free text from my dad: “You can do principal component analysis of a plate of spaghetti; all you’ll get is orthogonalized spaghetti, but you can do it.”

Gray: Band name: Gravid Proglottids? Re: the life cycle of tapeworms.

Kate: For some reason, this is a Dead Kennedys cover band in my head

Unsupervised Goblin

Kyle: dropped Kate at metro for her trip, immediately drove home and lowered the thermostat by 2 degrees
Kate: You could keep it colder if you want when I’m home!
Kyle: we've talked about this
it's an R-rated movie but temperature
let me have my Unsupervised Goblin feels

Pastel Eyes of Sauron

Emily: Frankly it’s hard to *not* sing about horse vagina when you’re surrounded by it staring down at you from all directions in cartoon form, like a thousand unblinking pastel eyes of Sauron.
